On Wall Street yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 519 points, with selling largely spurred by worries about Europe. American bank stocks took hits because investors fretted that debt problems overseas might reach the United States.
France came under pressure amid concerns that it could follow the US and become the next country to lose its top AAA rating.Standard & Poor's rating agency stripped the US of its AAA credit rating late last week, sending global stocks into a tailspin.
