India's exports grew by an impressive 81.8 per cent to USD 29.3 billion in July, Commerce Secretary Rahul Khullar today said. 
 Imports, too, grew by 51.5 per cent to USD 40.4 billion, leaving a trade deficit of USD 11.1 billion.
"Exports have done well...but my sense is that it (high export growth) is not going to sustain. We will see slowdown by this month," Khullar told reporters here.
During April-July 2011, the shipments grew by 54 per cent to USD 108.3 billion. Imports grew by 40 per cent to USD 151 billion.
During the same period, trade deficit stood at USD 42.7 billion.
Sectors, which have registered healthy growth, during the period, include engineering, petroleum products, gems and jewellery and readymade garments.
