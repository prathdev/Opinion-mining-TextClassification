Civil rights activists Kiran Bedi and Shanti Bhushan, detained by Delhi Police Tuesday morning ahead of Anna Hazare's fast-unto-death, were released in the evening, police said. 


 "Kiran Bedi and Shanti Bhushan have been released," Delhi Police spokesperson Rajan Bhagat told reporters. He said theirs was "preventive arrest".

Bedi and Bhushan were detained under the Delhi Police Act, on charges of refusing to comply with the directions given by a police officer.

Hazare, fellow activist Arvind Kejriwal and six supporters were sent to Tihar Jail by a special executive magistrate for not signing a bail bond and promising not to violate prohibitory orders.

Police had clamped prohibitory orders at the J.P.Park where the activists were planning to sit on fast against corruption.
