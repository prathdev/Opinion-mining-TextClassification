This trip is a beautiful dream to me. Body is tired,but mind is so happy.


Pro:
1. Tour guide(Henry) is great,he shared his personal experence in Euro pass over ten years.Let me can understand Europe culture more and deeper.
2. Whole trip is well organizational since there was limit time everyday to travel, and we went to 11 countries during 16 days. My many friends even can't believe that I can make this kind of traveling plan. But Ritz's experience allow me do it. To me, every sightseeing point was worthy to discovered. After I decided to join Ritz tour, I already did mind set by myself, this traveling should really tired,
but I can go to many different places during this trip.
3. Driver and tour guide provided good service. Driver even took us with unusual route (not always highway) in order to let us see really wonderful views. Tour guide cared about every guest during whole trip. He overcame and solved many problems or guests' complainment at first time.
4. Stay in nice and comfortable hotel.I joined this tour by myself, I just finished my study in USA,therefore, I have no rich budget to spend for my Europe trip. If I went to Europe by myself,I think I must choose bad and cheap place to stay.
5. Local tour guide are professional. Since we went to many different countries, there are local guides for us. They explained clear history stories to us. Let us can know more about whereever we traveled.I think if I went to those places by myself, I must can't gain so much knowledge like this.
6. On bus, I gained great sightseeing and learned different countries' culture by music and movies. It is great those place you just visited in the movies.


  Con:1. During this trip, you will eat much Chinese food(some is really not good),Maybe more
       differet food is better.
    2. Tour guide or driver need to check with hotel in current day, don't forget or mix about
       hotel information.
