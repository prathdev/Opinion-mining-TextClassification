Won 7 day trip to Taiwan sponsored by local radio station in SF.  Trip consisted of air, hotel, all transfers, daily breakfast and insurance.  Also included was air to Hualien to see Taroko Gorge Nat'l Park including lunch, train trip back to Taipei and morning tour seeing temples, shrines and Nat'l Palace Museum.  The rest of time was spent sightseeing on own, easy cheap metro transportation.  Saw the Taipei Zoo which encompasses a very large area.  We spent a whole morning seeing the various animals in their habitats.  It is very clean and worth the visit.  Short walking distance from Zoo is Maokong Gondola which took us on a ride up the mountain for a bird's eye view of area's tea fields.  It is the home to roughly 50 Teahouses.  We had a very enjoyable lunch at one. Visited the Night Markets (Shilin) and had dinner.  There are so many vendors it was hard to choose. Took the metro and went to Danshui (Fisherman's Wharf Rec. Area), wandered around and shopped for souvenir's.  Did so much in 5 days, lots more to do.  Ritz Tours delivered just what they promised.  My daughter and I were treated royally.  We had great tour guides, especially Florence in Hualien, very funny.  The Howard Plaza Hotel was beautiful, breakfast was outstanding.  It was centrally located, close to the Metro and shopping.  The trip was exciting, fun and we have no complaints.  I would choose Ritz Tours if I were to do this trip.
