My granddaughter and I were the only two signed up and we received 5 Star treatment throughout the entire trip. New drivers and guides at every country. Cambodia was a real surprise with it's extreme beauty and charm. Delicious cuisine and hotels were beautiful. I was so well pleased with the first Ritz Tour China Discovery that I wanted the second trip with Ritz. So happy I did and thank you Ritz for awesome tour. All planes were on time, even out of JFK which surprised me. Cathy Pacific is rated at the top for Asia air travel and with it's individual entertainment center kept us busy the 16 hours flying time. Vietnam is a sight to behold and the people are wonderful. Tons of scooters were fun to watch. Northern Vietnam took our breath away for it was so beautiful. Thailand's Temples exciting and full of history. Thailand's new shopping center is now closed from the riots and fire but we still managed to find some real good buys on leather. Don't miss Thailands big show Siam N......... can't remember the second word but it seats 2000 and show is outstanding. Hard to describe but highly worth it. Outside the show an entire historic village is set up with samples of food and then all of the sudden you are feeding an elephant. We did the extension to Hong Kong. Added the option of dinner in a revolving restaurant followed by a cruise of the bay.
Glad I did this trip and got to see everything I wanted to see. We never got sick, just stuck to bottled water for drinking and tooth brushing. Keep mouth closed in shower and you will be fine!
Thanks agan to all the nice folks along the way that made this a very wonderful trip full of memories.
