We visited 4 cities in 12 days.  Each day the itinerary was well planned and scheduled.  We saw as much as we planned to see.  It's amazing to see the historical sites and places.  Each day was full and tiring but it's worth it.
We had a great tour director who speaks perfect English.  He was informative, knowlegable, funny, witty, and understands the American culture. He was organized, responsible and helpful.
We stayed at 5 star hotels. Rooms were luxurious. Service was wonderful. Beds were comfortable.  We had restful nights and had plenty of energy ready to explore the next day.
It's great value to have almost all our meals included.  Hotel meals were good.  We had choices of Western or Chinese breakfast.
We enjoyed the great shows that were paid by Ritz Tours. Many people in our group took advantage of the discounted rate massage to ease the tired and sore legs and backs.
To top it off, we got to see the World Expo.  The experience was great to see expositions from different countries although we did not get into China pavilion due to the long line.
In summary, we had a great and worthwhile trip.  We went as a family of 9.  Our group had 26 people in total.  We will certainly plan our next trip with Ritz Tours.
