I took the 10 Day China Program this past September and I would not recommend it to my friends ever again. The price for the program is just not worth the trip.

1. Tour guides seemed not to care about our requests or needs. One couple in our group wanted to stay at the Great Wall for a bit longer. They were furious later because we were rushed from there just to go to a restaurant with shopping.

2. It's one thing to be secretly get kickbacks, but it's another thing to be blatant about it. The shopkeeper revealed that in exchange Ritz gets kickbacks for each head in our group. I found this ABSOLUTELY against the spirit of travel and want to warn people that everyone to know about this

3. Scenery and facilities are nice for the money we paid. But the service overall ruined this entire trip.

4. Food is bland. It was no better than our neighborhood chinese take out food

5. Rushed itinerary. We got back and it took my 3 days just to recover but the itinerary planning was not worth while. The Shanghai excursion could be done alone (the Shanghai Museum is underwhelming) and would have done more on my own
