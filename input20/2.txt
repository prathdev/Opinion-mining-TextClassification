The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) on Wednesday launched buses run on bio-fuel to mark World Bio-fuel Day. 
Painted by students of Karnataka Chitrakala Parishat, the KSRTC?buses carried the message of urgent need to switch from fossil fuels to eco-friendly fuels. 
Speaking on the occasion, Karnataka State Bio-fuel Development Board (KSDB) Executive Chairman Y B Ramakrishna said the department has planned to set up information centres to popularise bio-fuel in district headquarters across the State by December. 
The quantity of ethanol used in mixed fuels will be increased from five per cent to 10 per cent by the year end. 
“A unit in Peenya has already been producing 3,000 litre of bio-fuel everyday. We plan to start another unit with higher capacity in Devanahalli,” Ramakrishna said. 
Flagging off the buses on Doddaballapur and Chikmagalur routes, Transport Minister R Ashoka said both BMTC and KSRTC will encourage the use of bio-fuel. “More buses will have advertisements on bio-fuels,” he said.    
Besides, the KSDB announced its aim to plant 1.5 crore bio-fuel yielding saplings by 2013. 
Drawings by children aged around 10 and the students of the Chitrakala Parishat on the theme of bio-fuel were on display. A book. ‘Kusu Kanda Kanasinalli’ and a CD titled ‘Halakki Nudidaite’, comprising poems on the same theme were released on the occasion.
