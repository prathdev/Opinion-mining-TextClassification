I can vouch for the bad experiences that others have with Ritz Tours. We took a Thailand trip with Ritz and it was the most horrible experience in our lives. The tour guide did not speak any English at all. He was the lowest life form we have ever met. He demanded $60 USD from each person as tips before taking us to the airport for our flight home. He took us to go shopping at factories where he gets a cut of the commissions. Please keep in mind that none of the shopping factories were on the itinerary. No one wanted to look around or buy anything and he was extremely unhappy about that. We also have reasons to believe that the tour guide been through our bags as there are a few times we had to leave everything in the bus because we are on the road and have not checked into our hotels. We are fairly sure that while we are inside the zoo, our bags were "tampered" with as things are placed differently than the way we had placed them. So, I know this is common sense, but, whatever you do, make sure all your valuables are on you at all times. The tour guide was the WORST thing in this whole trip, but it does not stop there.

The food was poor. There was only 1 meal out of the whole week that we thought was decent. We are not picky eaters and we love Asian food, but the food they fed us was poor at best. The hotels were below average and they are very remote to the central areas. The hotels look ok from the outside, but the rooms were old and beatup. The whole tour was rushed so that we can get to the next shopping factory. Some of the attractions were omitted and there was no explanation.

When we complained to Ritz, they did not seem to understand our frustration. They did not even seem to care how we feel or treated. They even told us that this is the first time they ever received a complaint and gave an impression that there was something wrong with US.

The bottom line is I would not even recommend Ritz Tours to my worst enemy.
