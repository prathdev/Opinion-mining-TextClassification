My wife and I went on the .net tour.  Like the other gentleman in a previous post, there are two sites, .com and .net.  The .com is catered to English speaking and the .net is catered to Chinese speaking.   We did visit quite a few shopping sites which I didn't mind since I did end up buying some items but for those of you that have no interest in jade, tea, silk blankets, or pearls, do not go with the .net one. 

When we arrived in Beijing in early October 2008, we were surprise to hear that there would be 38 of us for our tour which was quite shocking.  This of course was after the Olympic games so I guess many people stayed away until after the ceremony.  

As the days went by, we started to get to know one another during the bus rides between different sites.  Everyone on board was very friendly and helpful towards one another.   I can say this is no vacation and is probably harder than actually going to work.  Wake up call around 6:30-7AM in the morning and back to the hotel around 8 to 9PM at night.  I would recommend you wear loose clothing and bring a good pair of walking/running shoes.  There was a lot of walking to be done every day. 

By day 10, people started to become more exausted and develop colds from all the walking and the constant blowing of the air conditioner.  The tour guide was telling us stories trying to keep our spirits up.  I am just glad that during this tour, my wife and I were able to get a few full body messages in to help us through this long trip. 

Overall, we got to visit many wonderful sites and met wonderful people.   If you don't mind some shopping, lots of walking, and a somewhat compress time schedule, then go for it!
