 Just returned from a 10 day standard tour with Ritz. This was my first time doing a tour and I was skeptical at first. It was also my first time in China. For someone who has never been to China and wants to get a flavor of the country, this tour is a great way to do it. You visit many of the main attractions like the Forbidden City, Great Wall, and Terra Cota Warriors. There was adequate amount of time spent at each location to see take things in and also do the usual touristy things like taking pictures. Of course, spending just one morning in the Forbidden City doesn't really do it justice but now I have a better idea next time I'm in China.

The hotels we stayed at were pretty good and got better as the tour went along. All the hotels had very nice lobbies but the rooms varied in quality. In Beijing and Wuxi, the rooms were on par with a Courtyard or Hampton Inn. The later hotels were closer to the 5 star hotels they mention in the brochures.

Each meal had a variety of foods and was plentiful. The issue here is that the restaurants appeared to be more of a tourist feeding area than the "local" restaurants they touted. The food overall was very good.

There was a forced shopping component which is why they can offer such low prices for the tour. I enjoyed it since they did mix in an educational component before you were put into their showrooms. There wasn't a pressure sales tactics unless you linger too long on an item. Definitely negotiate. Every place (except the silk factory) will allow you to negotiate even if the sign says no bargaining. Your "discounts" will vary but I got a nice jade necklace for 75% off their initial offer and other discounts at other places ranged from 30% to 50% off the initial offer.

Recommended: Yes
