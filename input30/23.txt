Regional Airports-Holdings International Limited (RAHI), a joint venture between IL&FS Transportation Networks Limited (ITNL) and Comet Infra-Developments Private Limited (CIDPL), on Wednesday, said its two private regional airports under development in Shimoga and Gulbarga will be operational by mid-2012. 
RAHI also has a unique business model involving aviation infrastructure, air services and geo-specific industry clusters in a bid to make regional aviation viable for private investment. 
RAHI Founder—Chairman Umesh Kumar Baweja said “RAHI has a three-pronged strategy for regional aviation, specifically in Tier-I and Tier-III cities in India. We will not only develop airports and associated infrastructure, but also have our own regional airline that will serve those cities.”
RAHI plans to operationalise its regional airline in tandem with the completion of two airports, for which discussions are on with manufacturers to source aircraft for the routes. 
“The goal is to establish 99 private regional airports by 2025,” Baweja said, adding it would invest Rs 3,000 crore in over 15 aviation infrastructure and services’ projects, in the next five years.
