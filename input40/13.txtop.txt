After reading all these mixed reviews, I felt compelled to write a review of my own to share a few things that I have found out about the company while on one of their tours.

The company and expectations:
I want to start by stating that the reviews for this tour operator on this site is a little bit deceptive. Ritz Tours is divided into two separate divisions: One is geared towards English-speaking Americans (ritztours.com) going to Asia (from their website, it seems like they will start going to Europe soon), and the other is geared towards Chinese-speaking Americans (ritztours.net) going to Asia and Europe.

If you're an English-speaker and choose to go to a tour offered by .net, needless to say, you will not like it. Those tours are conducted mainly in Chinese and the guides don't speak much English, there are more than the normal amount of shopping stops (I guess they figure the Chinese like to shop a lot), and they try to cram in as many sightseeing spots as they can. My dad's Chinese and I know I shouldn't generalize but I went on a trip to Italy with him once and it was a nightmare because all he cared about was just going to the famous spots, taking some pictures, and leaving without enjoying his time at any of them... so maybe that's the Chinese way to travel? In any case, those are who .net tours are catered to.

Now, I know that they're both the same company so there's no excuse for bad service on one or the other. However, you have to be aware of what you will be getting when you buy things. For example, if you're expecting a slow-paced tour when it's clear from their itinerary that every day will be a packed day, I don't find it very helpful that you rate the product a 1-star. Now, if you're expecting to visit certain sites and they don't take you there, then it's helpful that you rate them low because that would upset me too and it would show that they are not a good operator.

My trip in a nutshell:
I went on a .com tour to China & the Yangtze in June 2007 (so this review is a year late). For the price, it was perfect. The hotels I stayed in were very nice, the food was ok (though I did get sick of Chinese food after a while), the guides spoke perfect English and were informative, and I saw most of the places that I wanted to see in each city (if I had more money and time, I would have bought extra nights to extend my stay... but maybe next time). There was an older lady in my group who walked very slow and the tour leader always took care of her while the tour guide took care of the rest of us. Both the leader and the guide were very helpful.

Review in detail:
- Price: There are two "Series" you can choose from. The Premiere is way more expensive but they are limited group sizes and stay in the top-of-the-line 5-star hotels. They also have a Tour Director in addition to the local tour guides. The Deluxe is cheaper and groups can range from 6 to 40 people. The hotels are not-quite-as-nice 5-star hotels. You'll get local tour guides but if your group is small, they may not include a Tour Director.

The departures are from LAX, SFO, and JFK and prices include air, hotels, many (if not all) meals, transfers, sightseeing, show(s), and travel insurance.

- Air: They use Air China (which is not a great airline company but they have direct flights from the gateways to Beijing) and Cathay Pacific (which is an awesome airline company but they stop in Hong Kong first).

- Hotels: You have to remember this is China and they use their own star ratings. Actually, there really is no official guideline to rate hotels so what you think is a 5-star and what I think is a 5-star varies. Some of the hotels Ritz uses are true 5-star hotels. Others are rated 5-stars but I would consider them a 4-star. The location of the hotels varies from tour to tour. Sometimes it's city-centered, sometimes it's not very close to things.

- Guides: From my understanding after talking to the guide on my tour, the local tour guides (there's a different guide that accompanies you in different cities) are not Ritz employees. They are controlled and certified by the government of China and have to pass many tests to qualify as a tour guide of that particular city. I'm not sure if Ritz has any say in who they get but they probably have some say in who they don't want to get so it's good to take note of the bad ones and file a complaint with the company. The tour leaders are Ritz employees and they speak fluent English (mine had a British accent). My tour leader was funny and made the tour very enjoyable. He was also very helpful when need be but the informational stuff about the cities we visited all came from the local guides because they're more specialized in that city.

- Sightseeing: Spent around 2-3 hours in each place-of-interest. For me, it gave me plenty of time to walk around on my own but for some, it may not be enough. Not much time spent in the buses (thankfully). Some itineraries have free days but not the one I was on, so I should have added extra nights.

- Meals: Breakfasts are the best... buffet in the hotel. Lunches are always at some local chinese restaurant because we're on the road. It's served "family style", meaning, there are 10 people to a table and they bring about 15 different dishes and everyone takes what they want on their plate. Dinner varies between chinese at a restaurant or chinese/western in the hotel.

- Shopping: I must say there were quite a few shopping stops, which is good and bad. The good thing is that you can get your souvenier shopping done. The bad thing is that if you don't want anything, it's a waste of your time. I was told by a friend that this year, the Premiere series offers "optional shopping", meaning you can either go to the stores or have them take you back to the hotel. This would be preferable but it's only for the Premiere series. The shopping stops were as follows: Beijing cloissonet factory (interesting watching them make it), Xian freshwater pearls, Shanghai silk factory (interesting watching them make it also). Don't know about any of the other cities and don't know if they changed those stops since last year.

- Yangtze River Cruise: Well worth it. Ritz uses Victoria Cruises and the ships are quite nice. The rooms are small (as expected from a river boat) but the service is great. It's leisurely, which is a nice break from the usual fast pace. Every day there is a shore excursion included, and there are lectures and shows programed throughout the days.

Final thoughts:
Compared to their competitors, Ritz provides great bang for the buck. For the same itinerary, some of the other companies charge upwards of $1000 more! On the flip side, the cheaper companies will take you to the same places but the hotels are not very good... which is fine if you think the hotel is just a place to sleep.

The days are PACKED. We wake up very early (usually 7am) and return very late (if dining outside, then around 8pm) and we do a lot of walking all day long.

All in all, I would recommend this tour operator to my friends and family.

Update:
Regarding the insurance that is included, it is with Travel Guard (very reputable) and includes trip cancellation/interruption, medical expenses, medical transportion, delays, lost luggage, accidental death. So, basically, it's a really good insurance option... something you'd normally buy. Again, this is based on info from when I went last year... I'm sure they have more up to date info on their website.
