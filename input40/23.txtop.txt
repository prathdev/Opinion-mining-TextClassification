Ritz tours is one of the most exciting, and extremely cheap tour groups around. This past april i went on a 10 day tour to china. For only $1,400 i recieved plane tickets, and 10 days packed full of fun and excitment (meals were also included on almost every day!)In fact i had earlier looked for plane tickets to China and the tickets i found, alone cost more than the enitre trip!!!! (which included tickets food guides, etc.)

Thehotels we were put up on were defenitly top notch (some include the New Otani hotel in Bejing and the Hyatt in Shang-Hi).

On the tour we visited 3 cities, Bejing, Shang-Hi and Xian. We had one guide for the enitre tour, and then on top of that in each city we had another local guide. The Guides were helpful and by the end of the trip i would consider us to have been friends.

Ritz tours took us to all of the highlights in each city (The Great Wall, The Forbidden Citty, The Terra Cotta figures, Tiennamen Square, The Bund etc.) All of these entrance fees were also incluede in the tour. The food we were served at each resturant was amazing, and the chefs were able to adjust to many dietary needs.

We were also given free days in each city. On our free days we could do whatever we wanted and see different things that we wer personally interested in. However, if we wanted to there was an optional tour (which you did have to pay extra for) which was always very exciting. For the most part these tours were half a day, this way you had the night free.

I have only taken a tour to china, however im sure that Ritz's other tours are just as fabulous as the one i embarked on. I would reccoment Ritz to anyone who is looking for a cheap and fun approach to traveling.
