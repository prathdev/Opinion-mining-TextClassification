The iphone 3G. I have been a iphone holder for several years, and out of all the iphones i have had, my personal favorite is the 3G. Im a busy guy working around the clock, i need something to keep my files organized, with the iphone you not only keep your files organized, but you have special features for other tasks that you have. When i was in Best Buy, i had looked at laptops, and saw that the iphone 3G was out, I Had a Iphone 2G and i was able to upgrade. Im glad i did! I enjoyed the new features on the 3G, compared to the old iphone. The 3G is fast, which means i get tasks done quicker, and the smartphone features were worth it! 3G had very little problems compared to the others, 3G is reliable and fits in with my busy life. The little problems that i had were occasional lockups where i had to restart the phone, slow on occasion, Battery life problems but that was a underlying issue but apple said its not normal, but they fixed it. I have always enjoyed Apples products for years, the iphone 3G was (is) In my opinion "THE BEST" smartphone i have ever owned. Yes The 3Gs and the 4G are good too, but the iphone 3G has Little problems compared to the others.
