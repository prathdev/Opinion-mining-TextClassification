 We just returned from the Ritz Tours 10 Day Beijing-Xian-Shanghai Deluxe Tour and would recommend this tour. We had fantastic guides - particularly Scott Shi in Beijing and Nelson Zhu as our national tour guide who was with us throughout the 10 days. Both were very informative and had a great attitude. Overall, we were impressed with the food throughout the tour - the peking duck dinner was a little disappointing after all of the hype we heard, but overall we were very pleased with the quality.

We have traveled extensively and since we are younger, were apprehensive about taking a tour as we usually venture out on our own. Friends had recommended the company and we were very happy with the trip - the right blend of activities and free time (and we had a small group of only 10). The only downside for us was the length of time spent at the shopping stops (Silk Market, Pearl Market, Jade Market, Friendship Store). We felt that too much time was alloted for shopping.

Great price as we couldn't not have put this trip together ourselves for close to the price Ritz Offered. The Hong Kong Extension was definitely worth it and was a great value for money - we definitely had a great trip with Ritz Tours!
