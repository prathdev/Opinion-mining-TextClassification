Telecom giant Bharti Airtel Wednesday said it has appointed two new chief executive officers (CEOs) for its broadband and direct-to-home services. 
 "Both these verticals are part of the consumer business group that will lead the overall strategy for the business-to-consumer segment (B2C), with a clear focus on customer experience, product and service innovation and building an ecosystem around the B2C services," the company said in a statement. 
Rajiv Rajgopal has been appointed as the CEO of broadband and data services. Prior to this, Rajgopal has led the operator's mobile business in the Tamil Nadu and Kerala circles. Shashi Arora has been taken in as the CEO of DTH and media services. Arora earlier has led the mobile business for Delhi and Upper North circles, which are deemed Airtel's largest circles.
"With their rich experience and understanding of the business, we are confident that they will further consolidate and build on our leadership in both broadband and DTH verticals," said Sanjay Kapoor, chief executive officer, India and South Asia, Bharti Airtel.
