I recently flew Midwest Airlines for the first time April 8-11, 2008 from Kansas City to Minneapolis. My 6'5" husband and I were pleased with the amount of room and comfort of the seats. We also enjoyed the in-flight warm chocolate chip cookies. All of the planes we flew on had two seats per side, meaning no awkward middle seat.

Our check-in process was very smooth. We found all employees from baggage to plane to be particularly friendly (refreshing change from recent flights).

A bad snow storm threatened our return flight from Minneapolis. I was shocked when an airline attendant called and asked if we would like to take an earlier flight and miss the storm. We gladly did and later discovered that our original flight was cancelled. If not for the courtesy of the Midwest staff we likely would have been grounded in Minneapolis another 24 hours.

Two of the four planes we flew for this trip were like new. Even the older planes had large leather seats and foot rests.

The only limitation we found was the limited number of flights. Many flights also have a layover in Milwaukee, which is not the most exciting airport to be in for an extended period of time.
