 Five days after their induction into the ministry, Karnataka Chief Minister D V Sadananda Gowda on Tuesday allocated portfolios to five ministers including Balachandra Jarkiholi, who gets Municipal administration.

Jarkiholi held the same portfolio in the erstwhile B S Yeddyurappa ministry.
Vasanth Asnotikar, who has been given Fisheries, Science and Technology, has retained his earlier portfolio, according to a notification issued by Raj Bhavan.

While Varthur Prakash has been allocated Textiles, Narasimha Nayak (Raju Gowda) has been entrusted with Small Scale Industries and C P Yogishwar, the forest department. All the five joined the ministry on August 11, after Gowda went in for a second instalment of expansion of his ministry, taking its strength to 27.

Gowda has however retained departments of Tourism, Revenue and Health, which were held by mining barons G Janardhana Reddy, his brother G Karunakara Reddy and their associate B Sreeramulu, whom the BJP has chosen to keep away from the ministry following their names figuring in the Lokayukta report on illegal mining.

Reddy brothers have been exerting pressure on the party high command for their re-induction. As per the constitutional stipulation, Karnataka can have a strength of 34-member ministry.

Meanwhile parleys held within the party to expand the ministry has not made headway, leading to postponing of the exercise, according to party sources.
