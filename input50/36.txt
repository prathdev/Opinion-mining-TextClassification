Alleging that Cabinet Ministers were taking decisions on Anna Hazare's protest, the Gandhian's team today claimed that Delhi Police has become a ''puppet'' in the hands of the Central government and appealed to people to protest the detentions of anti-corruption protestors. 


 Lawyer Prashant Bhushan said a series of protests have been planned across the country to vent their anger "peacefully and in a non-violent" manner against the detention of Hazare and others.

"The decision to detain Hazare or to deny permission for his protest were taken by Cabinet Ministers. It is not the Delhi Police which is taking these decisions. There is no freedom for Delhi Police. It has become a puppet, an ornament in the hands of Central government," Bhushan told reporters.

He said a large number of students of Delhi University will protest outside Chhatrasal Stadium, which has been turned into a special jail, and court arrest while another protest will be organised at Pragati Maidan from where the activists will take a march to Jai Prakash Narain Park.

"A protest march will also take place tomorrow from India Gate to Parliament House," he said. Prohibitory orders have already been imposed in the localities mentioned by Bhushan.
Taking exception to the detention of Hazare from a flat, he said the detention of Hazare was a "kind of detention under Maintenance of Internal Security Act (MISA)".
