The Anna Hazare Team today expressed satisfaction over the venue offered to them by police for holding the indefinite fast against Lokpal Bill even as they denied any going back on their stand on the legislation. 
The Core Committee of the Hazare team met here this morning. The meeting was attended by Hazare and others including, activist Arvind Kejriwal.
"We are satisfied with the venue provided by Delhi Police. It is at a good location. Core committee is chalking out the plan on how to go about the fast," he told reporters.
Delhi Police last night offered Jai Prakash Narain Park adjacent to Firoz Shah Kotla Ground as the venue for his protest against the Lokpal Bill subject to permission from the land owning agency.
Kejriwal said there was no going back on the demands raised by them.
"We are not ready to compromise with anyone till our demands are met. The deadlock continues. We are open for any dialogue but there is no invitation from the government yet," he said.
His comments came when asked about activist Swami Agnivesh's comments that the Hazare team was "very very flexible" on issues like inclusion of prime minister or higher judiciary under ambit of the ombudsman but the sticking point is bringing lower bureaucracy in it.
