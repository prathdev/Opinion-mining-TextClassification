Internet giant Yahoo! India today announced the launch of 'Movieplex' service, which will allow users to enjoy licensed full-length movies for free. 


 Yahoo! India will collaborate with movie production houses to bring thousands of local Bollywood movies online to users for a piracy-free, quality entertainment experience, the company said in a statement.

It will also offer advertisers an opportunity to connect with their target audiences through immersive video content, it added. Movies currently available on Movieplex include Rock On, Rann, Dil to Baccha Hai Ji among others.

According to a ComScore report released in March this year, the Indian audience currently spends over 9.1 billion minutes watching online videos each month. Entertainment is the leading category in online video content consumption, ahead of news and sports content.

"Over 30 million Internet users consume 1.7 billion videos every month across India. With the increasing demand for online video, both consumers and content providers are looking for a trusted destination where quality content can be consumed in a piracy-free environment at their leisure," Yahoo! India Managing Director Arun Tadanki said.
