The Apple iPhone 3G Black (8GB) is truly amazing. It has plenty of memory, I have close to 60 apps, over 1,000 photos, and at least 250 songs. Memory has never been an issue for me with the iPhone. The iPhone is a great way to utilize the app store, which offers countless apps, anything from business to games. The camera on the iPhone produces crisp and clear pictures, although in low light some are rather grainy. The camera app was made even better when Apple made an update which allows you to zoom with the camera. The iPod on the iPhone is also a great feature and can hold a ton of songs while barely taking up any memory. My favorite part about the iPod on the iPhone is cover flow, which allows you to view all of the album covers and scroll through them, with a 3d looking effect. The phone portion of the iPhone is always functional and I have never had any problems with it. There are features that allow you to have an address book and favorite contacts, which is very helpful. Although plan for the iPhone are rather expensive, it is well worth the money. The iPhone is really the way to go.
