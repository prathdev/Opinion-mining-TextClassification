I got this phone for my birthday. I love the size of the screen. The email application loads very quickly. Over time the applications on the phone start to take longer to load, except for the email one. I have found that the Ipod sometimes will turn on at random times and play music by itself. I have also called people accidentally a number of times due to the fact that the phone is touch screen. The volume button on the side of the phone broke and will no longer go on silent with out vibrating constantly. Some apps will not open when you download them. Certain apps are only compatable with the Iphone 4 or the ipad. Apps also use alot of the battery very quickly. The battery only holds about 10 hours at best if you dont use it frequently. This is not worth the cost. If you need this phone for business then dont buy it because your battery will run out because you are using it for its intended purpose. Make sure to buy icare so you are insured incase you drop it and crack the screen. Most people i know who have had an Iphone, including me, have cracked the screen. In my case with this phone, it will cost me more money to fix the screen than to buy a new phone. Make sure you consider your options when buying this product. If it is purely for entertainment, thenit wont hurt to buy it, but if its for business, go with a Blackberry.
