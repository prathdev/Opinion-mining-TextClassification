My wife and I are experienced travelers. We travel both on our own as well as in groups, and our experience with Ritz Tours is the WORST EVER!

We took their China Scenic 14 days vacation (OAZ071004) on July 10 through 23, 2004. I regret to say that because of Ritz Toursâ€™ false advertisement as well as unscrupulous selection of tour guides and hotels, this tour turned out to be a hoax.

The hotels in Beijing and Xian were located very far from downtown areas. Moreover, the Xian Sheraton is located in the middle of slums, with the views on a garbage dump. Also, the rooms we were given in Beijing "New Century" and Xian "Sheraton" did not adhere to the 5-star hotel standards. The rooms were shabby, the furniture very old, the bathrooms were in very bad shape and hardly bearable because of the mold.

We were absolutely thrown off by the unprofessional behavior of Ritz Tours guides. Jackie, our tour lead, spent hours on the bus talking about how great Ritz Tours are, how lucky we all are, and how all of us should appreciate this and the guides, and he practically extorted tip money! These unprecedented hours of lecturing made everyone on the bus sick!

When it came to practical questions, Jackie was worthless. For the free time, he could not point out to the points of interest in Beijing, Guilin, or even his native Shanghai.

The full itinerary that Ritz Tours has provided to us at the time of purchase, did not mention any shopping. In fact, we spent a good part of the whole trip in the remotely located, overpriced shopping facilities. The whole group would be involuntarily taken to such a facility and kept hostage there until somebody would buy something!

After arriving back to the US, I have written a complaint to Ritz Tours describing these and other unpleasant experiences. Their response did not demonstrate any compassion or even understanding of the essence of what I was talking about.
