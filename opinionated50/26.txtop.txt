The Bottom Line: Dont fly with them! Maybe customer services reaction will change my mind as well as my post!

I bought a last minute flight to Boston due to a close friend passing away.  I found a wonderful price through Priceline.  When I departed from MSP my flight was an hour/half late.  These things happen with flights so no harm done.  When we made a stop in MLWK we sat on the plane for atleast an hour/half.  When the decision was made to head to BOSTON, we started taxiing out when the plane had Mechanical Failures! the bottom of the plane started shaking and making loud banging noises! to everyones alarm including flight attendants we went back to airport gate. Then sitting on the plane for another hour we were tolf that we needed to switch planes.

Okay, so when we finally arrive to Boston we are 4/half hours late!
Needless to say I missed my friends passing. 

Returning flight was almost no better!
We left gate 2 hours late. Arriving in MLWK we needed to change itineraries to board another flight, eventually we made it to Minnesota at 2:04 am. This was 3 hours late!

I am hoping Customer service will refund my ticket or put it towards another flight with their company.
So far customer service has been no help.
I will follow up when I get a response from Customer service, and hopefully post a good review for the way they handle these situatuons.

Hoping for the best,
patient flyer....
