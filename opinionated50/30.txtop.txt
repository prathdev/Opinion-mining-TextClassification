Once upon a time, Midwest was my ideal carrier. Wide, comfortable seats, absolutely wonderful and truly "midwest" staff, and great prices.

Those days are over. I heard that Northwest bought them out, which is a total loss. They've lost their personal touch, which used to make them my #1 carrier. The flights I was on (EWR to MKE, and return) were luckily sparse so I could at least spread out into the next seat. (I'm 5'5", 145 lbs. and I was hurting before I got off the plane.) The flight attendant on the trip out was nasty, cleared based in NYC area, but the return flight attendant more than made up for the other's behavior.

I guess the time when companies actually cared about their customers--in any industry--has gone by the wayside. How sad when CEOs are making money hand over fist and the little guys who actually see and hear the customers are getting shafted. I can't say that's happening here, but you can probably guess that it is. I can absolutely say that Midwest Air used to be the best care in the air as their motto goes, but somewhere along the way they fell into the trappings of competitive airlines and stopped caring. I don't care about the food, but I do care about comfort, and the new airliners they fly lack it greatly.

Here's the skinny: You need a quick flight with decent rates, this is your airline. Be prepared to be packed in and crunched, so if you're over 6'0", don't bother. I can't really comment about the check-in desk attendant because there was only one and she was on her cell phone the entire time (that was in EWR), but the one in MKE was great, polite, and professional.
