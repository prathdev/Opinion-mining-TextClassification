 I have never had a phone with internet, camera, touch screen or anythig "fancy".  I got this phone as a work phone and love it!  It takes awesome pictures.  I use i tunes to download music and plug it into my car stereo to listen to them.  Although I like that feature i tunes is a little overpriced, but thats besides the point.  I like the touch screen feature also.  I use the internet while driving for directions.  If you use mapquest, and don't have a GPS, like me you can punch in where you want to go and it will give you step by step directions as you are driving.  Also so many things are coming with the i pod docks which the iphone will hook up to.  I put it on the dock for my surround sound stereo at home and I can listen to my songs through those speakers.  I hardly use it to talk on anymore, its more of a little computer for me.  Most websites have mobile views so it makes it easier to view webpages from your small phone screen.  I do recommend the cases that they sell.  The phone seems fragile.  I bought the case when I bought the phone so I don't know from personal experience.  They were a little pricey when I got it, I think $200 but now I hear you can get them as low as $49 with a 2 year contract
